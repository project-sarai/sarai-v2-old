It did not come easy, just as how other ideas did not come over night, the team had to go through to numerous discussions and brainstorming sessions before they reach the eureka moment. Sarai was Abraham‚Äôs wife, and she was the first character in the Bible who was said to be barren. But then later on, God chose them to be the forefathers of the nation of Israel.\nIt was a miracle, of how Sarai was able to conceive. So the team thought it apt to adopt the name, thus the name Project SARAi came about. Project SARAi hopes to bring about development in our agriculture sector by providing our farmers with smarter options. Also, Project SARAi hopes to help in making a more resilient and a more proactive agriculture sector by using state-of-the-art technologies, and providing near real-time crop advisories.\nIt is a long work in progress, but with the sustained partnership with different State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) nationwide, different government agencies, and other institutions, the solutions are well along the way to reaching the farmers and other stakeholders.',

Other regions will experience more rains in June and planting will ensue. Earliest corn harvest (in July) is therefore expected from Mindanao.</li><li> There will be slight drop in rainfall in June but the moistened soil in May and further rain (though less in June) should be enough to sustain the corn/upland crop</li> <li>Rainfall is expected to be heavy in July and August. Drying could be a concern here if corn harvesting happens in these months (wet grains have less market price). Early planting or use of early maturing varieties (of corn and other suitable crops) is therefore advisable.</li> </li> For lowland rice, irrigated and rainfed, soil saturation is expected to happen in July-August.

        body: '<ul><li>Summer solstice is on June 21. Expect longer days than night up to September. Coupled with more rains, this is the reason why crop yields are higher these months. Short day plants i.e. plants requiring shorter day length to flower like sorghum, soybeans, some forages and vegetables will tend to be vegetative i.e. with more biomass formation. This will indeed be very advantageous for the northern part of the country like CAR and Cagayan Valley. But again the problem with typhoons. Hence the importance of planting time (early) in those areas to avoid the wraths of typhoon especially at harvest time and sometimes even flowering time (if planted late). This is the reason why you notice the tractors in Isabela are almost in a race at planting time during the wet season viz, to make best use of the weather. The late planters will wail. They might not know these equinoxes and solstices, but they know what they are doing!</li><li>The only concern now is the price of corn at harvest. With 2 million tons of feed wheat imported, equivalent to .7M tons of corn, that will indeed be a huge corn price depressant. Let us export corn to help our farmers!</li><li>Maybe this is the time to promote corn- legume rotation so that the farmers will not be beholden to one crop. We import a lot of those legumes anyway (mungbean, peanut and soybean) so there is local market. The rotation also perks up the corn yield after the legume crop because of the N-fixation capability of the legumes hence saving on N fertilizer. We have the local data to support that. It can also break the corn pest/diseases build up in the farm. Help the farmer, help the soil, help the corn: let us do crop rotation! In some countries that is even legislated.</li><li>Reminder again for the conditioning of mechanical dryers. Also for crops harvestable during dry months of March and April, like cassava. Planting fruit trees and other perennials now would also be ideal. Diversifying the crops in our farms would be good for the environment and farmers‚Äô livelihood</li></ul>',

Decreasing agricultural lands, limited water and fertilizer and environmental threats are some of the challenges agriculture industry. Closing existing yield gaps is one key strategy in meeting food demand [ CITATION Fol11 l 1033 ]. </p><p>Yield gap refers to the difference between the average farmers‚Äô (actual) yield and attainable yield (without nutrient and water limitations) [ CITATION Lab12 l 1033 ]. Some reasons, but not limited to, include farmers‚Äô characteristics, farm site characteristics, and technology available within the area. Analysis of yield gap can aid in determining expected increase in yield by alleviating observed constraints [ CITATION Bol11 l 1033 ].  Knowledge on yield gaps can help in (i) prioritizing locations and needs for agricultural research and development; (ii) assessing the effectiveness and impact of introduced technologies; or (iii) evaluate the impact of future scenarios, such as climate change [ CITATION Als09 l 1033 ].</p><h3>Objectives</h3><ul><li>To determine the gap between attainable and actual rice yields in 8 major lowland-rice producing areas (Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Oriental Mindoro, Iloilo, Bukidnon, North Cotabato and Davao del Sur).</li><li>To identify the yield-limiting constraints within the areas.</li><li>To develop decision-support system on rice integrated crop management (R-ICM) for the selected areas.</li></ul><h3>Activities</h3><ul><li>Nutrient  management study</li><li>Baseline survey</li></ul><h3>Expected Outputs</h3>  <ul><li>Yield-limiting factors in 8 major lowland-rice producing sites identified.</li><li>Decision-support system for rice developed.</li>       </ul><h3>Methodology</h3><p>The study make use of the data generated from the Variety x Nutrient Interaction experiment under Project 1 ‚Äì Study 2. Variety x environment interaction was analyzed using the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. The AMMI model analysis was performed using the SAS University Edition (SAS Institute Inc., 2014) software program. </p><p>Analysis of variance was done between locations and seasons for the effect of temperature. Comparison of treatment means was performed based on Tukey‚Äôs Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Test. Pearson correlation analysis was also done to determine the association between GDD and yield. The same procedures were done in water-use efficiency. </p><p>Characterization of farmers‚Äô field production practices and productivity was done by baseline survey. Results from experiment and baseline survey will be used in the development of decision-support system. Identification of farmer respondents were done. Respondents are from the adjacent areas near the experiment sites.</p><p>Baseline survey has two main factors; socio-economic and crop management and practices. Socio-economic factors include household size, farm assets, access to credit and risk aversion. Crop management and production practices include land preparation, variety, crop establishment, planting time, water availability, nutrient management, crop protection, harvest management, and post-harvest management. </p>',

Kung ikukumpara sa mga bansang Thailand, Argentina, Estados Unidos, at iba pang mga bansang nagtatanim ng mais, nahuhuli ang Pilipinas sa average corn productivity na 3.21 metric tons/hectare (mt/ha). Sa kasalukyan, ayon kay Dr. Art Salazar ay sapat na ang suplay ng mais sa ating bansa.</p><p>Isa sa mga tinuturing na dahilan ng pagbaba ng produksyon ng mais sa ating bansa ay ang pababago-bagong klima na nagdudulot ng mga kalamidad tulad ng bagyo at tagtuyot. Ang pamumugad din ng mga insekto ay isa rin sa mga dahilan ng pagbaba ng produksyon ng mais at ng mas madalas na paggamit ng pestisidyo. Ang corn borer at corn plant hopper ang mga halimbawa ng insekto na namumugad sa mga taniman ng mais. Bukod dito, ang pagkakaroon ng sakit ng mga halaman tulad ng corn rust, corn downy mildew, at corn leaf spot at ang regular na paggamit ng kemikal ng mga magsasaka ay nakaka-apekto rin sa produksyon ng mais sa ating bansa.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><strong>Agri-pinoy corn program.

Noong taong 2009, umabot milyong metriko tonelada ang produksiyon ng saging sa Pilipinas (BAS, 2010). Ang bansa ay pang-apat sa may pinakamalaking produksiyon ng saging sa buong mundo; pangalawa sa pagluluwas ng Cavendish, at una sa banana chips sa pandaigdigang pamilihan.</p><p>  Ang saging ay isa sa iilang prutas na mabibili anumang panahon.

Wala itong taba, <i>cholesterol</i> o <i>sodium</i> na maaaring makasama sa kalusugan. Subalit sa kabila ng malalaking potensiyal na kontribusyon ng saging sa nutrisyon at seguridad sa pagkain ng mga Pilipino, mababa pa rin ang konsumo natin sa saging kumpara sa pang araw-araw na pangangailangan ng ating katawan. Sa 400 gramo na rekomendadong pagkain ng prutas at gulay, bumaba ang konsumo ng Pilipino mula 104 gramo noong 1978 sa 54 gramo noong 2003 (Pedro et al., 2003).
